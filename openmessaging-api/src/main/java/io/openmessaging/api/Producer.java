/**
 * A {@code Producer} is a simple object used to send messages on behalf of a {@code MessagingAccessPoint}. An instance
 * of {@code Producer} is created by calling the {@link MessagingAccessPoint#createProducer(Properties)}  method.
 * <p>
 * It provides various {@code send} methods to send a message to a specified destination, which is a {@code Queue} in
 * OMS.
 * <p>
 * {@link Producer#send(Message)} means send a message to the destination synchronously, the calling thread will block
 * until the send request complete.
 * <p>
 * {@link Producer#sendAsync(Message, SendCallback)} means send a message to the destination asynchronously, the calling thread won't
 * block and will return immediately. Since the send call is asynchronous it returns a {@link Future} for the send
 * result.
